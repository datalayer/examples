This example demonstrates how to leverage Datalayer's GPU kernels to accelerate text generation using Mistral 7B Instruct v0.1.  Mistral 7B Instruct v0.1 is a instruct fine-tuned version of the Mistral-7B-v0.1 generative text model using a variety of publicly available conversation datasets.


Text generation can be viewed akin to performing inference tasks, where the model interprets input prompts to generate meaningful and contextually appropriate text responses.

It is inspired by the original source code available at [Get SH*T Done with Prompt Engineering and LangChain GitHub](https://github.com/curiousily/Get-Things-Done-with-Prompt-Engineering-and-LangChain/blob/master/mistral-7b.ipynb).
