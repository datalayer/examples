# Sentiment Analysis with Gemma

This example demonstrates how you can leverage Datalayer's **Cell Kernels** feature on JupyterLab to offload specific tasks, such as sentiment analysis, to a remote GPU while keeping the rest of your code running locally. By selectively using remote resources, you can optimize both performance and cost. This hybrid approach is perfect for tasks like sentiment analysis via llm where some parts of the code require more computational resources than others.

For a detailed explanation and step-by-step guide on using Cell Kernels, check out our [blog post](https://datalayer.blog/2024/08/23/cell-kernels) on this specific example.
