    "\n",
    "**Serial CPU Execution:** this execution time represents the baseline performance of running the intensive computation sequentially on a single CPU core.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel CPU Execution**: Utilizing Python's `multiprocessing.Pool`, the workload is distributed among all available CPU cores (`mp.cpu_count()`). This parallel approach demonstrates faster execution compared to the serial CPU execution due to concurrent processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Serial GPU Execution**: The computation is performed on a single GPU. Its execution time is much lower than the one of Serial CPU, highlighting the GPU's parallel processing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel GPU Execution**: Parallel execution across multiple GPUs showcases significant speedup compared to serial and parallel CPU and serial GPU executions. This highlights the advantage of leveraging multiple GPUs for parallel processing tasks.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we observed that parallel execution on multiple CPU cores (`Parallel CPU`) outperformed serial GPU (`Serial GPU`), serial CPU (`Serial CPU`) and parallel CPU (`Parallel CPU`) executions for the given workload. This emphasizes the efficiency of utilizing multiple CPU cores.\n",
